##  Ask

The Florida short-term rental market is one of the most competitive and dynamic in the U.S., shaped by seasonal tourism, diverse neighborhoods, and varying property types. To succeed in this environment, hosts, investors, and city planners need clear insight into what drives profitability.

The business task of this project is to **analyze Airbnb data from Miami**, and later extend to other Florida cities, to identify the key factors that influence pricing, occupancy, and revenue. By focusing on elements such as neighborhood, property type, amenities, and guest reviews, this study aims to uncover trends that can guide smarter decisions.

**Stakeholders**
- **Hosts & Property Managers:** Optimize listings and maximize occupancy.
- **Investors:** Identify profitable neighborhoods and property types.
- **City/Tourism Planners:** Understand short-term rental impact on communities.

**Key Metrics (KPIs)**
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Occupancy Rate (%)
- Revenue per Available Listing (RevPAL)
- Amenity Impact Scores (WiFi, pool, parking, ocean view, etc.)
- Neighborhood Performance (ADR & occupancy by area)

**Guiding Questions**
- How do pricing and occupancy vary across neighborhoods in Miami?
- Which amenities add the most value to a listing?
- How does property type affect revenue?
- Are there seasonal patterns in demand and pricing?
- What insights can hosts, investors, and planners use to make data-driven decisions?

This completes **Day 1 – Step 1 (Ask)** of the case study.  
Next steps: Create folder structure (`/data/raw`, `/docs`, `/sql`, `/r`) and add Miami datasets from Inside Airbnb.
